title: "Trajectory Design for Space Systems"
---

## Course Description
We will place a heavy emphasis on optimization-based techniques and study optimal control formulations for solving trajectory optimization and model predictive control problems.
Applications of interest will include interplanetary trajectory optimization, rocket entry-descent-landing, asteroid proximity operations, and planetary rover path planning.
A strong emphasis will be placed on practical applications through coding implementations in Python and evaluation in simple simulation environments.
Finally, a course project will be included to allow students to gain further experience on an algorithm or application of their choice.
